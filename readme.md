Simple project that allow to use webpack aot and material design

Install all the packages:
```
 npm install
```

To run it:

```
npm run start-prod
```

#### Scss:
It contains a work around, before to compile with ngc I trasform in css the scss file through a gulp task (`"start-prod": "gulp"`). In your component load the `css` file
If there will be a better solution I'll update it
